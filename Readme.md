## Problem Statement

Investigations often face time delays due to the need for updating team members, higher officials, or new investigators about new evidence, which slows down case resolution. Additionally, efficient team collaboration is hindered by information gaps arising from team shifts, officer replacements, or case transfers, making it difficult to track evolving facts and assumptions. Furthermore, unstructured case presentation in court makes it inefficient to distinguish facts from assumptions and present logical case connections.

## Solution

Our solution provides a visual, interactive case-mapping platform that enables seamless collaboration by structuring facts, assumptions, evidence, and timelines in real time. This ensures instant updates across investigators, higher officials, and new team members, thereby reducing delays and improving clarity when presenting the case in court.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Case Mapping with Custom Markup Language**: Allows investigators to map cases visually using a custom markup language, enabling structured representation of suspects, victims, evidence, and facts in a graphical format.
2. **Real-Time Collaboration & Status Updates**: Ensures that every new piece of evidence, fact, or assumption is instantly updated and accessible to all team members, higher officers, other stations, and new investigators, eliminating delays in case progression.
3. **Blockchain-Powered Tamper-Proof Evidence Management**: Stores evidence and case progress on a blockchain-based system, ensuring transparency, security, and protection against manipulation.
4. **Interactive & Automated Investigation Flow**: Uses React Flow for an interactive visual representation of case elements, allowing for intuitive understanding of case connections.
5. **Figma-Like Approach for Investigators**: Enables investigators to build and modify case structures dynamically, making the system user-friendly and efficient.
